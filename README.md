# V Alpha 2
Value Instrument Prototype - Version 2

## Contains

This repository contains three distinct code bases:

- Web Interface
- Smart Contract
- MongoDB Entity Store

### Web Interface

A client side responsive web app, build with the VCore library and including a Theme and Plugins. All written in plain Javascript.

**VCore**
A bunch of modules and helper functions to aid the development of user interfaces

**VTheme**
A first theme build with VCore.

**VPlugins**
A bunch of functionality to create and display content. Plugins control the Theme.

### Smart Contract

The VToken smart contract can be setup optionally. This is a special kind of token, that has several properties which can be set to the initiators liking.

### MongoDB Entity Store

The MongoDB Entity Store resolves user names to Web3 addresses, when a distributed ledger is used, and also enables token accounts and transactions in VToken format, if no distributed ledger is used (as a simulation of such).
